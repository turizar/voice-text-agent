# Dependencies for Complete Voice Agent
#
# IMPORTANT: Python 3.10 or higher is required
# The TTS library and its dependencies (specifically 'bangla') require Python 3.10+
# due to the use of union type syntax (e.g., bool | None)
#
# To check your Python version: python3 --version
# To create a virtual environment with Python 3.10+: python3.10 -m venv venv (or python3.11, python3.12, etc.)
